================================ <br>
Medical imaging <br>
- Computer scans images faster than human eye (and more consistent)
- Helping doctors not replacing them
- Application of computer vision and deep learning in medical
 - Data (medical images) 
	- costly 
	- Hard to interpret: depends on different types - need different tools
	- Where to get data? 
		- Collaborate with hospital (in the future)
		- Database (current medical imaging competition)
- Neural network architecture:
	- Many different architectures 
	- Each has pros and cons
	- VGG16: easy to understand
	- Restnes
	- Dense
	- Condense
	- ect.
