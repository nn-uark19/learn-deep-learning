=============================<br>
 Meeting summary
Topic:<br>
- Dr. Duong's research: face aging, blurred image face recognition<br>
- Dr. Quach's 3d face detection alignment<br>
- PyTorch tutorial from Dr. Quach

Detail about research<br>
1. Face age prediction <br>
2. Blurred image face recognition<br>
- bench marking, reprocessing database<br>
- A new model should be designed for low resolution images like blurred face. <br>
3. Dr. Quach's 3d face detection alignment<br>
-Merge two model (detection and tracking) MTCNN<br>
-Since MTCNN model doesn't consider orientation we need to use 3d image in our new MODEL.
