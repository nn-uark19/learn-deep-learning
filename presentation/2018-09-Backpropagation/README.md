This is the video I mentioned today in our meeting. I think it does a good job of explaining how backpropagation works and the calculus involved. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIeHLnjs5U8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIeHLnjs5U8) <br>
The video is part of a whole series on neural networks that I've found very helpful.
