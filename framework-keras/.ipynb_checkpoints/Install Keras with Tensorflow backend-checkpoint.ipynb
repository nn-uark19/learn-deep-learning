    "Cuda is architecture platform supporting parallel computing created by Nvidia. It is essentially a software layer between the CPU and the GPU. Cuda is well-suited for both graphical applications like 2D or 3D modelling, graphic intensive video games as well as computational applications in biology or in crypography. Interestingly, machine learning applications can be both graphically as well as computationally intensive. Hence, every library or framework that we are going to talk about comes with cuda support. The cuda toolkit has inbuilt libraries performing important computations involving linear algebra, fast fourier transforms etc. Cuda makes single threaded workflow on CPU and accelarated parallel processing on GPU possible. The cuda execution model has three parts- grids, blocks and threads.The grid runs on a device(GPU), blocks run on multi processors and threads run on scalar processor(cores). With cuda, hardware resource allotment for thousands of threads running in hundreds or thousands of GPU cores over millions or even billions of transistors is made extremely efficient. Cuda essentially splits up code into threads by itself and assigns them to GPU cores thus highly speeding up computing.\n",
